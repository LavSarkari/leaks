>[ bin 0x01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=navuBR4aJSs&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&index=2) of LiveOverflowâ€™s legendary binexp playlist.  
he starts with **installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox**, setting up the old-school way.  
but tbh? iâ€™m not doing that.
if i face somthing i can't do on wsl,
i'll switch to somthing where i won't face it.

## my flavor = kali + wsl

iâ€™m comfy with **Kali WSL on Windows**.  
itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and no need to boot up a full VM.  
just open terminal and vibe.

i know it's not *exactly* what liveoverflow used, but the goal is to **learn**, not copy.  
as long as i can compile stuff, run gdb, and poke binaries we good.

â†’ [this is how you can install Kali WSL in 5 mins](https://docs.kali.org/kali-infrastructure/kali-on-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux)

## terminal basics (but real)

liveoverflow did a good job breaking it down, but hereâ€™s my own breakdown after playing with it:

- `pwd` â†’ where tf am i
- `ls` â†’ whatâ€™s here
- `man` â†’ manuals for commands
- `cd` â†’ teleport
- `nano` â†’ pain, but works (still using it lol)
- `gcc` â†’ turns `.c` into breakable binary
- `cat` â†’ to read a file
- `less` â†’ ease the pain while reading huge files
am not gonna explain every lil shi- just hit this site for all the cmds !!

## why iâ€™m not skipping this

iâ€™ve touched linux before for random CTFs, booted up a few VMs,  
but never **used it like a builder**, like someone whoâ€™s here to break binaries on purpose.

this time iâ€™m doing it clean. slow. intentional.  
not because itâ€™s tough, but because  
**iâ€™m tired of guessing. i wanna actually know wtf iâ€™m doing.**

## ðŸ’­ tl;dr

- didnâ€™t go with the whole Ubuntu + VirtualBox route  
- using **Kali on WSL**: smoother, faster, less bloat  
- terminal used
