so uh  
yeah.  
this is **lav**, and this site is **lavleaks**- where i’m kinda just throwing shit that doesn’t fit anywhere else.

i'm not some pro. i don't work at google.  
i’m just some dude from lucknow with too many tabs open  
and a habit of writing down stuff that *might* matter one day.

i’m learning in public.  
i’ll get things wrong. probably lots of it.  
but at least it’ll be mine.

### what this blog will have:
- broken writeups from ctf nights that ruined my sleep
- weird lil tools that make my life easier
- notes from falling into tech rabbitholes at 2AM
- some Ls. maybe Ws too.  
- and yeah, some **cybersecurity/AI/noise** crossover things, but only what makes sense to me.

---

### what it won't be:
- fake productivity guru vibes
- boring SEO-driven junk
- tutorials that sound like chatgpt threw up

---

i don’t have it all figured out.  
not trying to be the best.  
just trying to be **real** in a space full of polished lies.

if you vibe with that-
cool.  
if not, that’s cool too. this is mostly for me anyway.
