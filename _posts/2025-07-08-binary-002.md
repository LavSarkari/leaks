>[ bin 0x02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGoUaCmMNpE&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&index=4) of LiveOverflow’s binexp series  
he asks to write a simple `C` program and compile it.  
i did. it's literally a `main()` with `argv`.  

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if(argc == 2) {
        printf("YO BUD %s :P \n", argv[1]);
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <name>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## breaking it down (my way)

- `argc` → how many arguments (arg count)
- `argv[]` → actual args (arg values)
- `argv[0]` → the name of the binary itself
- `argv[1]` → the string we pass

super basic stuff, but you gotta **get it into muscle memory**.

## compile + run

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
./main lav
```

```txt
YO BUD lav :P
```

no input?

```bash
./main
```

```txt
Usage: ./main <name>
```

## tl;dr

- got back to `C` (yes i’ve written before in diploma but this hit diff)
- wrote a basic `argc/argv` CLI prog
- compiled with `gcc`, ran it, aliased it
- now i’m comfy with the structure again
