not a tutorial. not some guru dump. just a log.

i’m lav. 18. and i just started learning binary exploitation…  
from a **[9-year-old playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN)** on youtube.  
the one by **LiveOverflow** - a literal legend in this space.

---

## why now?

never touched binaries before.  
yeah, i’ve been deep into hacking, scripting, bug bounties, all that.  
but **this**… reverse engineering, registers, stack overflows, all that _deep magic_ - i used to think it wasn’t for me.  
too complex. too low-level. too much “real CS”.

turns out, it’s just memory.  
and memory leaks.

---

## the plan?

there is no plan.

i’m going video by video, playing with the code, opening gdb, writing down what breaks my brain.  
not gonna pretend i know everything.  
not gonna clean things up for the blog.  
this is my **public notepad**, not a resume.

some days i’ll write wins.  
some days it’ll be confusion.  
both count.

---

## what to expect

- gdb outputs  
- stack diagrams (maybe ascii style if i’m feeling nerdy)  
- broken C code  
- “wtf just happened?” moments  
- and occasionally… joy. the kind that hits when things click.

---

## why even post this?

cause learning in public feels real.  
cause someone else might need to see the *messy middle*.  
and mostly, cause this isn’t just about binaries.  
it’s about showing up.

---

so yeah, this is **lavleaks/binexp** - my journey from zero.
